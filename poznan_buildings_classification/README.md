# Poznan's buildings classificator

Project from Advanced Image Processing subject to classify 5 popular buildings in Poznan using Bag of Words model.
## Description
Action steps:
1. At first, I create a script to generate a lot of vocabularies with different numbers of words. I used the k-means algorithm and generate 5 models to every single vocabulary with the same number of words. It caused that k-means generate different initial values every time, which gives every time a different set.

Project in progress.
